Dictionary Pounce
====================

A random competition arose with an IM contact where we&rsquo;d greet eachother not with
the standard &lsquo;hello&rsquo;, &lsquo;roflmao&rsquo; etc, but with an all-caps word 
beginning with P. The more obscure, the better. Being a nerd, and moreso liking to
one-up people, I wrote this simple script and had Pidgin trigger it when that contact
came online. Said contact thought it was hilarious and spent all morning logging on and off.

Purpose
--------------------

Select a random word from a specified word list and
send it, with definition if available, to an XMPP (jabber/gtalk)
recipient.

Usage
--------------------

Intended to be triggered by a &lsquo;Buddy Pounce&rsquo; in Pidgin. For example,
when a certain user comes online. Given a large enough list of words,
a randomly selected one is usually obscure and fairly entertaining.
PUDDENING, for example. The act of becoming a pudding? Perhaps.

Seriousness
--------------------

Very low
